---------------------------------------- PROJECT FOR VICHARAK COMPUTERS -----------------------------------------



# PROJECT REQUIREMENT:
    Develop a firmware application for ESP32 Dev Kit that downloads file via HTTPS from a public URL and writes
    it to SPIFFS(SPI flash file system) at a speed of at least 400KBps.


#PROJECT DESCRIPTION: FIRMWARE APPLICATION FOR ESP32 DEV-KIT-V1 THAT USES SPIFFS FOR FILE SAVING AND HTTPS FOR FILE DOWNLOAD VIA HTTPS PROTOCOL 
    NOTE: Version-2 is just the updated and advance version of Version-1 with new programs


Prerequrisits: 
    1. ESP32 Plugin for Arduino IDE (This project is implemented in ESP32 Arduino Framework) 
    2. SPIFFS File system (SPI Flash File System)
    3. WiFi library and module
    4. WiFi ClientSecure module and HTTP module for ESP32
    5. Arduino IDE version 1.8.18
    NOTE: SPIFFS file systems is not optimized for newer arduino IDE versions, so it is better to use version 1.8.18

Project Description
    Developed a firmware application for ESP32 Dev-Kit-V1 microcontroller using Arduino IDE & Arduino-ESP32 Plugin, 
    This firmware downloads web file via HTTPS from a public URL and writes it to SPIFFS(SPI flash file system) at a speed of at least 150KBps 
    - Implemented WiFi connectivity that uses WiFi modules for internet connectivity. 
    - Implemented “Https Client-secure” module for Web connectivity, Https GET requests
    - Implemented SPIFFS(SPI-Flash File system) that creates files for storage of packet data.
    - The project is implemented using ESP32 Plugin for Arduino IDE & SPI-Flash file system.

SPIFFS Limitations Casestudy PDF:
    I also wrote PDF for this project that explains the frequency bottlenecks & latency issues in SPIFFS. 
    It details the performance limits of SPIFFS and how it affects this project.

Libraries and header files
    #include SPIFFS.h
    #include FS.h
    #include <WiFi.h>
    #include <WiFiClientSecure>
    #include <HTTP.h>
NOTE: After everything is set. You can directly select you ESP32 development board for Arduino IDE and select port and Directly flash the code.
FOOTNOTES: This project contains version-1 and version-2. 
Version 2 is updated version of version 1 that contains larger buffer for larger payload data for HTTPS GET request.

Early prototype is the version on of the project that contains basic blueprint like structrue for the Final project, which is version-2. The system design and program structrue 
is same in both, but the program implementation and structrue changes.

Includes the below libraries/header files & their functions in the code.
  #include "FS.h"
  #include "SPIFFS.h"
  #include <WiFi.h>
  #include <HTTPClient.h>
  #include <WiFiClientSecure.h>

///---WiFi FUnction used in the project---///
    WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
    WiFi.status() 
    WiFi.SSID(); 

///---SPIFFS Functions used in this project---///
    SPIFFS.begin(true)
    SPIFFS.open(filename, FILE_WRITE);
    File.readString()
    File.read();
    File.close();
    SPIFFS.remove();
    file.write();

///---HTTP & HTTPS FUnctions used int this project---///
    WiFiClientSecure client;
    client.setInsecure();  // skip certificate check
    HTTPClient http;
    http.begin(client, url)) {
    http.GET();
    http.getStreamPtr();
    http.end();
